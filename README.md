   Welcome to my color app! 
==============================

Heroku Project link: https://damp-journey-7569.herokuapp.com/login

In this app you can choose a color and save it to your own swatches, and make posts to your friends about yoru favortite colors!

For this Ruby on Rails app I used a special Javascript colorpicker call jscolor:

I also used a couple google Material icons (for some some buttons):

Here are the wireframes and user stories (sorry they are a bit rough)

Approach ======================

My goal was to have a site where you can share colors with others by posting them to a feed of all users' colors. You could then select colors from the feed and add them to your colors. Eventually you would be able to vote up or down ont the colors in the feed. You would also be able to create palettes with your colors and share and vote those as well. 

Unfortunately I didn't get far enough to be able to post colors (although I feel I was very close). So right now you can only make colors and make posts separately. I also didnt' get to the delete route for either the colors or the posts - so I'm a bit behind.

Also the heroku deployed version doesnt have the sign-up modal and is missing some styling that is on the git-hub version. I keept working on the git hub version, but didn't want to mess up the working heroku version before class presentation.
